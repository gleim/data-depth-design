The table below maps the treatments in the [main experiment](link) to the scripts that should be run for each of them.

See the design of the [Main Factorial Experiment](TODO: LINK) for more information.

In the Table below, the columns a–j refer to the factors (each row shows the levels for that factor in the treatment). Columns 1–5.c show the number of the script to run for that particular treatment.

|a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|1|2|3|4.a|5.a|5.b|5.c|
